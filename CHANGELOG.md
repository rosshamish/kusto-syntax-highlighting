v1.1.2

v1.1.1

- Allow whitespace between function name and opening paren, e.g. `materialize (` is now supported. Before, it had to be `materialize(`.
- All functions are scoped as `support.function` now, instead of some being `keyword.function.kusto`, which, for many themes, shares a color with `keyword.operator.kusto` which does not parse well for humans.
